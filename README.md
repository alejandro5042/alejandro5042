Hey there! 😁

I'm Alejandro, Chief Software Engineer at [NI](https://www.ni.com). My focus is on AI, Cloud, and Hardware Drivers, with a passion for Developer Tools.

Been coding since I was 9 years old. I especially enjoy finding, organizing, and leading difficult engineering initiatives. I love people as much as code. You'll find me on an adventure abroad, hitting up a new restaurant, or debugging the nastiest problems late at night. Always up for a cold beer 🍺 and an "impossible" challenge! 🚀

How I think: Customer Obsession, YAGNI, Agile Manifesto, Growth Mindset, Clean Code, UNIX Philosophy, Jobs-to-be-done, Worse is Better, Fire And Motion, Genius of the AND, and Do the Real Thing.
