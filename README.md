Hey there! 😁

I'm Alejandro, a Chief Software Engineer at NI. My focus is on AI, Cloud, and Hardware Drivers, with a passion for developer tooling.

Been coding since I was 9 years old. I especially enjoy finding, organizing, and leading difficult engineering initiatives. I love people as much as code! You'll find me on an adventure abroad, hitting up a new restaurant, or debugging the nastiest problems late at night. Always up for a cold beer and an "impossible" challenge! 🚀

Developer philosophies I ascribe to: Customer Obsession, YAGNI, Agile Manifesto (and not just Scrum), Growth Mindset, Clean Code, UNIX Philosophy, Jobs-to-be-done, Worse is Better, Fire And Motion, Genius of the AND, and Do the Real Thing.
