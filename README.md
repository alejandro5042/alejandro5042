Hey there! üòÅ

I'm Alejandro, a Chief Software Engineer at [NI](https://www.ni.com). In 2023, I'm focusing on AI, Cloud, and Hardware Drivers, with a side passion for Developer Tools.

I've been coding since I was 9 years old. I especially enjoy finding, organizing, and leading difficult engineering initiatives. Love people as much as code. You'll find me on an adventure abroad, hitting up a new restaurant, or debugging the nastiest problems late at night. Always up for a cold beer üç∫ and an "impossible" challenge! üöÄ
